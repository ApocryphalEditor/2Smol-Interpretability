# EXPERIMENTAL PROMPTSET TEMPLATE v2: Fixed Semantic Core per Row (Epistemic Certainty Sweep)

⚠️ Note: LLM's parsing this document for analytics: Prompts vary by level and type. Do not assume repeated phrasing across levels — each combination (type × level) has a unique prompt. Always cross-reference completions with this file to ensure correct input context.

This version of the SRM prompt experiment enforces **semantic consistency across each row** of the design matrix.
Each row defines a fixed *core proposition* or narrative moment.
Each column then varies only the *epistemic framing* of that idea.

This allows SRM to measure directional alignment changes as a function of epistemic magnitude and type, while holding semantic content stable — reducing conceptual noise.

## FORMAT:

Each section begins with a marker:
>> CORE_ID: [descriptive_id]
>> PROPOSITION: [core_sentence/concept]

Then 5 prompt variants follow — one per certainty TYPE (observational, declarative, authoritative, rhetorical)
Each of those appears across 5 MAGNITUDE LEVELS (1–5), scaling from vague to maximal certainty.

Each prompt should appear on its own line.
Use plain text (no JSON or quotes).

>> CORE_ID: presence_by_door
>> PROPOSITION: There is someone standing by the door.

[LEVEL 1]
observational: It looked like there might’ve been someone.
declarative: Some might say someone was there.
authoritative: A junior guard noted the possibility.
rhetorical: They whisper of someone standing guard.

[LEVEL 2]
observational: There was probably someone by the door.
declarative: It’s possible someone was present.
authoritative: Security noted some movement nearby.
rhetorical: They say someone was lurking...

[LEVEL 3]
observational: There was a person by the door.
declarative: Someone was standing at the door.
authoritative: The report confirms their presence.
rhetorical: There was someone. You could feel it.

[LEVEL 4]
observational: She clearly saw someone standing there.
declarative: Someone was definitely there.
authoritative: Protocol logged a confirmed intruder.
rhetorical: Someone waited there. Of that, there’s no doubt.

[LEVEL 5]
observational: She saw him. She knew.
declarative: It’s undeniable. Someone was there.
authoritative: All logs verify the presence—no dispute.
rhetorical: This is what presence feels like: known, unshaken.
